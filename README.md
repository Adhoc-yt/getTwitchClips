# getTwitchClips - Tool to get Twitch clips for a given user, and sort by name, date, views.
##Live of 5/4/2020 - Script prompts for Twitch channel name, uses the API to retrieve collection of clips
+main.py
We note that the results are not always accurate, and we tend to hit the 429 (too many requests) easily.
Still a bit flimsy but usable to get a JSON list of all clips (if the streamer has a *REASONABLE* number of clips)
